    <h1>About A Little About Us:</h1><br>
    <p>Hey there, I'm John, the guy behind John's Car Empire. I've been a car enthusiast for as long as I can remember, and over the years, I've managed to collect some pretty amazing vintage cars. Each one has its own story, and I love sharing that with fellow car lovers. Look below to see my collection so far and lemme know what you think!</p>
    
    <h1>My Current Collection:</h1><br>
    <p>1964 Pontiac GTO – 89,000 miles. Picked this one up off a guy who had it sitting for years. Still pulls strong, nothing fancy, just raw muscle.</p>  

    <p>1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 – 72,000 miles. Heavy car but when that 454 kicks, it pins you back. Loud, rough, and exactly how it should be.</p>  

    <p>1969 Dodge Charger R/T – 95,000 miles. Big body, feels like you’re driving a boat, but it’s got presence. Always gets looks, no matter where it’s parked.</p>  

    <p>1971 Plymouth Hemi ’Cuda – 41,000 miles. Hardest one to find, cost me more than I wanted to admit. Worth it though, people stop and stare every time.</p>  

    <p>1968 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR – 83,000 miles. First time I fired it up, the whole garage shook. Doesn’t matter how many times I drive it, it still feels special.</p>  

    <p> 1970 Buick GSX Stage 1 – 77,000 miles. This one surprised me. Doesn’t get talked about as much, but man, the torque hits harder than most.</p>  

    <p>1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 – 88,000 miles. Lighter on its feet than the others. Handles better, feels quicker in the corners. A real driver’s car.</p>  

    <p>1970 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am – 80,000 miles. Clean lines, nice balance. Not the wildest one I’ve got, but maybe the easiest to live with.</p>
